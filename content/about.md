JessConf is a parody. Have you checked a calendar lately? There is no
Novemeber 31st. Sorry.
[Jessie Island, Cowley Beach, Australia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jessie+Island/@-17.6730051,146.1716304,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6978d66e414c95e1:0xd1e4b020b4d8678f!8m2!3d-17.6734879!4d146.1738743")
does exist, though.


However, all the people featured in the JessConf lineup
[are real](https://twitter.com/jessysaurusrex/status/742572243662708736").
There are so many fantastic female technical presenters who
[just happen to be called Jess](https://twitter.com/jessicard/status/742767291398397952),
or a variation thereupon.

If you are looking for speakers for your conference, why not ask one of the
wonderful people featured here? They are all listed with their Twitter accounts,
and a link to some of their prior talks.

Do you really need another conference lineup of all men? Or as many female
speakers as speakers called Steve?
